    "# Looking into the SAT data of New York schools\n",
    "This project is built based on the DataQuest article of the series Building a Data Science Portfolio: [Storytelling with Data](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/data-science-portfolio-project/). \n",
    "The project consists in analyzing the [SAT scores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAT) of high schoolers from different boroughs, along with other information related to it. As explained in the [article](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/data-science-portfolio-project/):\n",
    "> The SAT, or Scholastic Aptitude Test, is a test that high schoolers take in the US before applying to college. Colleges take the test scores into account when making admissions decisions, so it’s fairly important to do well on. The test is divided into 3 sections, each of which is scored out of 800 points. The total score is out of 2400 (although this has changed back and forth a few times, the scores in this dataset are out of 2400). High schools are often ranked by their average SAT scores, and high SAT scores are considered a sign of how good a school district is.\n",
    "\n",
    "There has been allegation of the SAT tests being unfair with racial groups in the US, we're going to look at this too.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1 Collecting our data\n",
    "This is the moment in which we are going to download the files and look for extra information to complement it, so we can move to see how it looks like.\n",
    "### 1.1 Downloading all data\n",
    "\n",
    "To make such a big analysis, we need to take the right amount of data. Thinking about that, we are going to take data from the following sources:\n",
    "* [High School Directory](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2014-2015-DOE-High-School-Directory/n3p6-zve2) - directory containing information about each high school\n",
    "* [SAT scores by school](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/SAT-Results/f9bf-2cp4) — SAT scores for each high school in New York City.\n",
    "* [School attendance](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/School-Attendance-and-Enrollment-Statistics-by-Dis/7z8d-msnt) — attendance information on every school in NYC.\n",
    "* [Math test results](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/NYS-Math-Test-Results-By-Grade-2006-2011-School-Le/jufi-gzgp) — math test results for every school in NYC.\n",
    "* [Class size](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2010-2011-Class-Size-School-level-detail/urz7-pzb3) — class size information for each school in NYC.\n",
    "* [AP test results](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/AP-College-Board-2010-School-Level-Results/itfs-ms3e) — Advanced Placement exam results for each high school. Passing AP exams can get you college credit in the US.\n",
    "* [Graduation outcomes](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/Graduation-Outcomes-Classes-Of-2005-2010-School-Le/vh2h-md7a) — percentage of students who graduated, and other outcome information.\n",
    "* [Demographics](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/School-Demographics-and-Accountability-Snapshot-20/ihfw-zy9j) — demographic information for each school.\n",
    "* [School survey](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/NYC-School-Survey-2011/mnz3-dyi8) — surveys of parents, teachers, and students at each school.\n",
    "* [School district maps](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/School-Districts/r8nu-ymqj) — contains information on the layout of the school districts, so that we can map them out.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Getting background information\n",
    "\n",
    "- New York city is divided into 5 boroughs, which are essentially distinct regions;\n",
    "- Schools in New York city are divided into several school disticts, each of which can contain dozens of schools;\n",
    "- Not all the schools in all of the dataset are high schools;\n",
    "- Each school in New York city has a unique code called a `DNB` or District Borough Number;\n",
    "- By aggregating the data by district, we can use the district mapping data to plot district-by-district differences;\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2 Understanding our data\n",
    "After all the collection we need to see how it works, but first of all lets import the libraries we are going to use.\n",
    "### 2.1 Setting up the environment\n",
    "Lets import all libraries we are goingo to need to clean, analyze and display the data."
